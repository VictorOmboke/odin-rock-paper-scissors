The goal of this project is to create a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game that works directly in the browser console using Javascript. This game tests my understanding and application of Javascript logic by using functions, for loops, the console, and conditionals. 

This project was assigned to me from The Odin Project's JavaScript section in their 'Foundations' curriculum.
