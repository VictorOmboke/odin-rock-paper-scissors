The goal of this project is to create a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game that works directly in the browser console using Javascript. This game tests my understanding and application of Javascript logic by using functions, for loops, the console, and conditionals. 

After creating the game to work in the browser console I have now taken the logic for the console based game and made a UI for the game. I used DOM methods in JavaScript to take the logic from the console and place it on to the browser and used CSS/Flexbox to style the UI and format everything to my liking.

This project was assigned to me from The Odin Project's JavaScript section in their 'Foundations' curriculum.
